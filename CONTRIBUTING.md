# Contributing Guidelines

We welcome contributions that improve the Atlas Homes Frontend. Please follow this workflow to keep the project healthy and predictable.

## Branching Model
- Create feature branches from `main` using the convention `feature/<short-description>`.
- Use `fix/`, `docs/`, or `chore/` prefixes for bug fixes, documentation updates, and tooling work.

## Development Process
1. **Sync `main`:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. **Create a branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/add-property-carousel
   ```
3. **Install dependencies** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Run the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. **Run lint checks before committing:**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
6. **Commit with a descriptive message:**
   ```bash
   git commit -am "Add testimonial slider autoplay controls"
   ```

## Pull Request Checklist
- [ ] Reference related issues in the description.
- [ ] Summarize high-level changes and screenshots when UI is impacted.
- [ ] Ensure `npm run lint` and `npm run build` succeed locally.
- [ ] Update documentation when new configuration, commands, or data model changes occur.
- [ ] Request review from at least one maintainer.

## Code Style Notes
- Prefer functional React components with hooks.
- Keep JSX lean by extracting repeated structures into sub-components inside `src/components`.
- Tailwind utilities are preferred; fall back to component-level CSS modules when necessary (see `src/components/commonComponents/navbar/Navbar.tsx` and `navbar.css`).
- Store reusable data objects (e.g., navigation links, property definitions) in `src/data.ts` to keep presentation logic focused on rendering.

## Commit Message Format
- Use the imperative mood ("Add", "Fix", "Refine").
- Prefix the first line with a category when helpful, e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`.
- Keep the subject line under 72 characters; include additional context in the body when needed.

## Release Notes
- Tag release commits in `main` with `vX.Y.Z`.
- Summarize key UI or data changes in the release description, especially if property inventory is updated.

Thank you for contributing!
